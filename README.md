# Dell

My scripts for Dell Inspiron 13 Touch 2 in 1 for Kubuntu.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Screen rotating
| Command         | Info        |
| ---             | ---         |
| `normal.sh`     | normal state of monitor and input |
| `right.sh`      | monitor on side (90deg), keyboard off, rotate axis of mouse and touch screen |
| `upsidedown.sh` | upsidedown monitor, keyboard off, rotate axis of mouse and touch screen |
| `toggle.sh`     | toggles between normal and upsidedown mode. Can be used -n for normal, -u for upsidedown and -r for right mode |

### Monitor backlight
- `MonitorOff.sh`   turn off the monitor backlight (param -l locks the session)
  
## Autoscreen rotate
Bind the script `toggle.sh` to the key code generated by opening the lid to tablet mode by `xbindkeys` utility.


### Prerequisites

#### Install xbindkeys

`sudo apt-get install xbindkeys`

Create the default config file for xbindkeys

`xbindkeys --defaults > /home/your-user-name/.xbindkeysrc`

When thats done, install xbindkeys-config, the GUI for xbindkeys (note: the GUI is optional, you could just edit the config file with a text editor).

`sudo apt-get install xbindkeys-config`
